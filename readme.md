## troubleshooting

**location fetch**

location fetch will fail on ungoogled-chromium or any browser which disables location access. in some cases, location may be spoofed instead (see [workaround for ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium/issues/1551#issuecomment-1738237814))
