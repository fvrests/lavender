# Privacy policy

## What information does Lavender collect?

### Geolocation Data

Lavender's weather features use the Geolocation API, which prompts the user's browser for approximate current location in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates.

### Local and Chrome Sync Storage

Lavender accesses the user's Local Storage and may access the user's Chrome Storage, if browsing via the Chrome extension.

## How does Lavender use the information it collects?

### Geolocation Data

The user's location data is stored in the user's browser and is not pre-fetched, indexed, stored, or cached in any way by the developer of Lavender. Location data obtained through the browser may be subject to additional privacy policies provided by the user's browser, such as Google's Privacy Policy, found [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). The coordinates collected are used to query OpenWeather's Current Weather Data API to obtain weather data for the user's area. The OpenWeather privacy policy can be found [here](https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy).

### Local and Chrome Sync Storage

The user's local and Chrome storage are used to save UI settings within the browser and allow them to persist across Chrome extension instances using the Chrome Storage API. User data and settings are not indexed, stored, or cached by the developer of Lavender and are accessible only to the user.

## Limiting access to personal data

The user may deny access to location data by clicking the "Not now" link when asked for permission to access location. If the user has already enabled location access or updated their UI settings, settings and location data can be deleted from the user's Chrome Storage by navigating to Chrome > Settings > Privacy and Security > "Clear Browsing Data" within the Chrome browser. Please be aware that browsing data for products & sites offered by other parties may be deleted through this action.

## Dispute resolution

Complaints about Lavender's privacy practices can be directed to the developer at <fvrests@icloud.com>. Reasonable steps will be taken to attempt to resolve any complaints.

## Changes to the privacy policy

Notice of any changes to Lavender's privacy policy will appear on this page. Please periodically review this page to stay up to date on Lavender's privacy practices. Continued use of the extension after updates to the policy have been posted will be considered an agreement to the revised policy.
